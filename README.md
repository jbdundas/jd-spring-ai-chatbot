# jd-spring-ai-chatbot
Sample Spring AI chatbot application, using Open AI.

This GenAI tool will book your flights for you, initially through written chat mode ( verbal support planned for later). I plan on including more features in the near future. 


Note: To view an example of the API response, please see the screenshots folder. It contains the following:
1. The CURL command which was used to connect to this Spring Application's API. 
2. The logging statements( in the logs) which displays the ChatGPT response.
